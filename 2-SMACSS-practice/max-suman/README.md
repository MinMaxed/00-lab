##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Tried to do it based on what each section is doing/targeting, so basic stuff in base, more page specific themes in layout, other sections in modules. Though honestly, not confident in my organization of them. CSS is difficult for me.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I commented out section as I went along to make sure the changes were happening on the new sheets.
